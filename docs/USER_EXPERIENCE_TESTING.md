1. "What do you think this visualization shows?"
2. "How does it help you understand the app's state?"
3. "Is it distracting or helpful during voice interaction?"
4. "Would you prefer it larger, smaller, or different style?"

### Volume Level Indicator Testing

#### Test Criteria
- **Guidance**: Does it help users speak at appropriate volume?
- **Clarity**: Are the color codes (green/orange/red) intuitive?
- **Timing**: Does it respond quickly to volume changes?
- **Usefulness**: Do users find it helpful or ignore it?

#### Test Questions
1. "What do the different colors mean to you?"
2. "Does this help you know how loud to speak?"
3. "Would you look at this during voice interaction?"
4. "How could this be improved?"

## ðŸ”§ Usability Testing Protocol

### Pre-Test Setup

#### Participant Preparation
```
1. Brief introduction to study purpose
2. Consent form and recording permission
3. Background questionnaire
4. Device/browser setup verification
5. Baseline comfort assessment
```

#### Technical Setup
```
1. Screen recording software active
2. Audio recording for voice interactions
3. Performance monitoring tools running
4. Network conditions documented
5. Device specifications recorded
```

### During Testing

#### Observation Points
