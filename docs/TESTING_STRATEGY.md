```
1. User opens application
2. User grants microphone permission
3. User taps voice button
4. Visual feedback shows recording state
5. User speaks a question
6. Recording stops automatically or manually
7. Visual feedback shows processing state
8. AI transcribes speech accurately
9. AI generates appropriate response
10. Response is spoken back to user
11. Visual feedback returns to idle state
```

#### Test Scenario 2: Permission Denied
```
1. User opens application
2. User denies microphone permission
3. Application shows helpful guidance
4. User follows guidance to enable permission
5. Application detects permission change
6. Voice features become available
```

#### Test Scenario 3: Network Error
```
